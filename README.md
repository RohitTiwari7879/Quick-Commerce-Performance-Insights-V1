# Quick-Commerce-Performance-Insights-V1
"Descriptive Analysis of Quick Commerce deliveries in Gurugram Sector 45 using Power BI."
📊 Quick Commerce Performance Insights - Volume 1 (Minor Project)
📌 Project Overview
This project is a baseline descriptive analysis of the Quick Commerce delivery model (inspired by Blinkit and Zepto) in Gurugram. As an MCA graduate (2025) from ITM University, I developed this dashboard to bridge the gap between high-speed delivery promises and operational data reality.

❓ The Problem Statement
In the 10-minute delivery industry, every second counts. The challenge was to analyze 1,000+ delivery transactions to identify why certain areas, specifically Sector 45, were experiencing higher latency during peak hours.

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Average Delivery Time: Monitored the average time from order placement to doorstep.

Order Accuracy (POR%): Tracked the percentage of perfect orders delivered without errors.

Sector 45 Trends: Identified hyper-local bottlenecks where traffic and store packing times were causing delays.

Revenue Pulse: Area-wise revenue distribution to identify high-value zones.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Visualization: Power BI Desktop

Data Source: Microsoft Excel (Cleaned & Structured)

Skills: Data Modeling, Descriptive Analytics, Sentiment Mapping (Word Clouds).

💡 Key Insights
Latency Correlation: Found that a 5-minute increase in delivery time led to a 15% drop in customer ratings.

Zone Performance: Sector 45 emerged as a high-revenue zone but required better rider allocation during "Dinner Peaks."

🚀 Future Roadmap (Volume 2)
This Minor Project (v1.0) is the foundation for my upcoming Major Project (v2.0), which will integrate:

SQL ETL Pipeline for cleaning 10,000+ rows of dirty data.

Python Scripts for automated data sabotage simulation and processing.
